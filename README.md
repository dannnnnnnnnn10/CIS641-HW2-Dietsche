## Technical Background
I have experience in java from taking 162/163 last year before applying to the masters program. I took a python course during my original undergraduate studies, back in 2016. I've messed around a little bit in javascript, though I'm not overly familiar with it.

# CIS641 Semester Project

My group is using [this tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/) as a baseline guide to create a simple roguelike game. We will be expanding on the tutorial, adding additional features in order to increase the complexity from where it leaves off. This project is giving us experience in both doing project management and programming in Python.
